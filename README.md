### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hey, everybody!
I graduated from Sechenov Medical University in Moscow, specialising in bioengineering and bioinformatics. 
For more than 2 years I have been working as a bioinformatician at FMBA.

You will hardly ever see me in the lab, I prefer the computer.
My responsibilities include: biostatistics, mathematical modelling, analysis of RNA and DNA sequencing data. Performing systems biology data analysis (including differential expression, GWAS, SNP/CNV/ROH searches, selection signature analysis, phylogenetic analysis).
